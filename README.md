<h1>Bookshelf</h1>

<p><a href="https://marcusvanwinden-bookshelf.vercel.app">View project</a></p>

<p>A React application in which users can discover books and track their reading history. I implemented authentication and shared a user's state through context. I used patterns such as compound components for the modals. In development mode, components are monitored on performance, and the app is tested with unit, integration, and E2E tests.</p>
